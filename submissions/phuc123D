## Developer

* **Name**: Tran Hoang Phuc

* **Experience**: Background in blockchain app development, experience participating in multiple testnets, building basic smart contracts, and integrating dApps with wallets.

## Project

### Name & Category

* **Project**: BioIdentity
* **Category**: identity / social

### Description

BioIdentity is a vApp for managing and verifying **decentralized identity**.
**Problem**: Personal data is usually stored on centralized servers, prone to leaks, and outside user control.
**Solution**:

* Allow users to verify their identity and reputation via **on-chain credentials**.
* Integrate an XP/reputation system based on community activity.
* Ensure users have full ownership and control over their personal data.

### SL Integration

* Use **Soundness Layer (SL)** to guarantee data integrity and verification of credentials.
* Apply **SL Proofs** for identity verification without exposing sensitive information.
* Leverage **SL consensus** to store credentials and reputation history, preventing forgery.

## Technical

### Architecture

* User → BioIdentity dApp (frontend) → Backend API (service layer)
* SL handles credential verification & storage
* Sensitive data stored off-chain (WALRUS/IPFS), only hashes/commitments are kept on-chain

### Stack

* **Frontend**: React + Tailwind
* **Backend**: Node.js (Express)
* **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer (SL) + EVM-compatible chain
* **Storage**: WALRUS / IPFS

### Features

1. Decentralized identity verification (DID + SL proofs)
2. Reputation/XP system linked to on-chain accounts
3. Secure personal data management and sharing

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)

* [ ] Basic UI (login, profile)
* [ ] Simple SL integration for verification
* [ ] Store test data on IPFS

### MVP (4-8 weeks)

* [ ] Full features (DID, credentials, BioXP)
* [ ] Testnet deployment
* [ ] Community user testing & feedback

## Innovation

BioIdentity stands out by combining **identity + social reputation** on blockchain.

* Users retain **full control over their data** instead of relying on centralized storage.
* SL proofs allow identity/reputation verification **without exposing full data**.
* Designed for fast, transparent, and community-driven adoption.
